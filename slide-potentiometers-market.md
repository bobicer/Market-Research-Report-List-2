<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Slide Potentiometers Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Vertical Type</li><li>Horizontal Type</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Slide potentiometers are available in two main types- vertical and horizontal. Vertical slide potentiometers are designed to be mounted in a vertical orientation, with the slider moving up and down along a track. This type is commonly used in applications where space is limited or where a vertical sliding motion is preferred. Horizontal slide potentiometers, on the other hand, are mounted horizontally, with the slider moving from left to right or vice versa. This type is often used in audio equipment and mixing consoles.</p></p>
