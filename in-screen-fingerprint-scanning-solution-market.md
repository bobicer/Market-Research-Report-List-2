<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The In screen Fingerprint Scanning Solution Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Optical</li><li>Ultrasonic</li></ul></p>
<p><p>In-screen fingerprint scanning solutions come in two main types: optical and ultrasonic. Optical scanners use light to capture a 2D image of the fingerprint, while ultrasonic scanners use sound waves to create a 3D image. Optical scanners are typically faster and more cost-effective, but they can be less secure and accurate compared to ultrasonic scanners. Ultrasonic scanners, on the other hand, offer higher security and accuracy levels, making them ideal for more sensitive applications. Both technologies are widely used in various devices such as smartphones, tablets, and laptops.</p></p>
