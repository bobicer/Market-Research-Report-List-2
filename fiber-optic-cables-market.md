<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Fiber Optic Cables Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Single-Mode</li><li>Multi-Mode</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Fiber optic cables are classified into two main types based on the mode of transmission: single-mode and multi-mode. Single-mode cables have a smaller core size, allowing for a single mode of light to pass through, making them ideal for long-distance communication. Multi-mode cables have a larger core size, enabling multiple modes of light to travel through, suitable for shorter distances. Each type serves different purposes in the market, depending on the required transmission distance and bandwidth capacity.</p></p>
