<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Multi Chamber Sputtering System Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Load-lock type</li><li>Batch Type</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Multi Chamber Sputtering System Market includes two main types: Load-lock type and Batch Type. Load-lock type systems allow for continuous operation by loading new substrates while the process chamber remains under vacuum. This increases efficiency and reduces downtime. Batch Type systems, on the other hand, process a fixed number of substrates in a batch, which can be useful for smaller production runs or when a controlled environment is required for each batch. Both types offer unique benefits based on the specific needs of the user.</p></p>
