<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Carbon Filtration Systems Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Granular Activated Carbon</li><li>Block Carbon</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Carbon filtration systems are commonly available in two main types: granular activated carbon (GAC) and block carbon. Granular activated carbon filters are comprised of small grains of carbon that trap impurities as water passes through. Block carbon filters, on the other hand, consist of densely packed carbon particles that provide more surface area for filtration. Both types are effective at removing contaminants such as chlorine, volatile organic compounds, and sediment from water, making them popular choices for residential and commercial use.</p></p>
