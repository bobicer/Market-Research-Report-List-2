<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Hydrophobic Intraocular Lens IOLs Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Not Pre-loaded IOLs</li><li>Pre-loaded IOLs</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Hydrophobic intraocular lenses (IOLs) come in two main types - Pre-loaded IOLs and Not Pre-loaded IOLs. Pre-loaded IOLs are already pre-loaded in the injector system, making the surgery process more efficient and reducing the risk of contamination. On the other hand, Not Pre-loaded IOLs require manual loading by the surgeon, which can be more time-consuming and increase the likelihood of contamination. Both types of IOLs offer hydrophobic properties, which help to repel water and prevent clouding of the lens.</p></p>
