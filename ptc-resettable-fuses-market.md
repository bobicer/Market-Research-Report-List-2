<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The PTC Resettable Fuses Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>CPTC</li><li>PPTC</li></ul></p>
<p><p>PTC resettable fuses, also known as polymer positive temperature coefficient (PPTC) devices, are used in electronic circuits to protect against overcurrent and short circuits. There are two main types of PPTC fuses: CPTC (hold current type) and PPTC (trip current type). CPTC fuses have a specified hold current level at which they will trip, while PPTC fuses have a specified trip current level. Both types of PPTC fuses provide reliable protection for electronic devices by quickly self-resetting after the fault is cleared.</p></p>
