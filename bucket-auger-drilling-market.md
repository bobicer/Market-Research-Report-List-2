<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Bucket Auger Drilling Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Double Start</li><li>Single Start</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Bucket auger drilling is commonly categorized into two main types: double start and single start. Double start augers have two spirals on the auger blade, providing more cutting edges and faster drilling speeds. This makes them ideal for soft to medium-hard materials. Single start augers, on the other hand, have only one spiral, making them better suited for harder materials or rocky conditions. Both types of augers are widely used in construction, mining, and geotechnical engineering projects.</p></p>
