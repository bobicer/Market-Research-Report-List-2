<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Polyethersulfone Dialyzers Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>High Permeability</li><li>Low Permeability</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Polyethersulfone dialyzers are a type of dialysis membrane used in hemodialysis procedures. High permeability dialyzers have larger pore sizes, allowing for efficient removal of waste products and excess fluids from the blood. On the other hand, low permeability dialyzers have smaller pore sizes, resulting in slower but more precise filtration. High permeability dialyzers are ideal for patients with high levels of waste products in their blood, while low permeability dialyzers are suited for those requiring gentle and controlled filtration.</p></p>
