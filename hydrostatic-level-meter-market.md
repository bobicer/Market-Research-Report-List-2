<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Hydrostatic Level Meter Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Side-mount Type Hydrostatic Level Meter</li><li>Throw-in Type Hydrostatic Level Meter</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Hydrostatic Level Meters are used to measure the level of liquids in tanks or containers. There are two main types in the market: Side-mount Type and Throw-in Type. </p><p>Side-mount Type Hydrostatic Level Meters are installed on the side of the tank and measure the liquid level by detecting pressure changes. They are suitable for tanks with limited access or narrow openings.</p><p>Throw-in Type Hydrostatic Level Meters are placed directly into the liquid and measure the level based on the pressure exerted by the liquid. They are often used for open or small tanks where side-mount installation is not practical.</p></p>
