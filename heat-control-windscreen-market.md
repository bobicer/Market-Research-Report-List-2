<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Heat Control Windscreen Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Heated Wire Windshield</li><li>Heated Coated Windshield</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Heat control windscreens are available in two main types: Heated Wire Windshield and Heated Coated Windshield. Heated Wire Windshields use a network of heating elements embedded between layers of glass to defrost and de-ice the windshield. On the other hand, Heated Coated Windshields have a thin layer of conductive film applied to the glass surface which heats up when electricity is applied. Both types provide improved visibility in cold weather conditions by preventing frost and ice buildup on the windshield.</p></p>
