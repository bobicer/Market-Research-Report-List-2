<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Cataphoresis Material Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Cathodic</li><li>Anodic</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Cataphoresis materials are used in the process of electrocoating, which involves applying a coating to a metal part through an electric charge. There are two types of cataphoresis material markets: cathodic and anodic. In cathodic cataphoresis, the metal part being coated acts as the cathode and attracts positively charged paint particles. In anodic cataphoresis, the metal part acts as the anode and attracts negatively charged paint particles. Both processes result in a durable and corrosion-resistant coating on the metal part.</p></p>
