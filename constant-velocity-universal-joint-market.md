<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Constant Velocity Universal Joint Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Ball</li><li>Fork</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Constant Velocity Universal Joints are mechanical devices used to transmit power between two shafts at varying angles. There are two main types of CV joints: Ball and Fork. Ball joints utilize spherical balls to allow smooth rotation at varying angles, making them ideal for high-speed applications. Fork joints, on the other hand, use fork-shaped yokes to connect the shafts, providing better flexibility in terms of angle rotation. Both types are commonly used in automotive and industrial applications for efficient power transmission.</p></p>
