<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Supermarket Refrigeration Equipment Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Plug in</li><li>Remote</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Supermarket refrigeration equipment can be categorized into two main types: plug-in and remote systems. Plug-in systems refer to units that are self-contained and can be plugged directly into an outlet, making them easier to install and maintain. On the other hand, remote systems require a separate compressor and condenser located outside the store, allowing for quieter operation and less heat output inside the supermarket. Both types of systems have their own advantages and are chosen based on factors such as space availability and energy efficiency.</p></p>
