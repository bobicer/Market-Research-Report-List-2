<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Machine Tool Probe Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Contact Probe</li><li>Non-Contact Probe</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Machine Tool Probes can be categorized into Contact Probes and Non-Contact Probes based on their operating mechanism. Contact Probes make physical contact with the workpiece to collect data on dimensions and surface finish. They are commonly used for precise measurements in manufacturing processes. On the other hand, Non-Contact Probes use optical or laser technology to gather data without touching the workpiece, providing advantages in terms of speed and avoiding potential damage to delicate surfaces. Both types of probes play crucial roles in ensuring quality and efficiency in machining operations.</p></p>
