<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Dental X Ray Flat Panel Detector Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Direct Conversion</li><li>Indirect Conversion</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Dental X-ray flat panel detectors are used for digital dental imaging. There are two main types of detectors in the market: direct conversion and indirect conversion. Direct conversion detectors convert X-ray photons directly into electrical signals, resulting in higher image quality and better contrast resolution. Indirect conversion detectors convert X-ray photons into light, which is then converted into electrical signals. While indirect conversion detectors are more common and cost-effective, direct conversion detectors are becoming increasingly popular for their superior image quality.</p></p>
