<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Planetary Gear Set Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Single Planetary Gear</li><li>Double Planetary Gear</li></ul></p>
<p><p>A single planetary gear set consists of a central gear, called the sun gear, surrounded by multiple other gears, known as planet gears, which rotate around it. This type of gear set is commonly used in applications where a compact design is needed. On the other hand, a double planetary gear set includes two sets of planet gears rotating around two sun gears. This configuration allows for higher torque transmission and smoother operation than a single planetary gear set. Both types are widely used in various industries for power transmission and speed control.</p></p>
